1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Yeah, that's about right.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,400
Yep.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,400
Thanks, mate!

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,160
Are you alright there?
Fine.

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,040
Sorry?

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm fine. Where's my tea?

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,840
I didn't know you wanted one. Would
you like me to put the kettle on?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,680
No, no. I'm fine.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,760
Oh. OK, just hold it there,
thanks, mate. Hold up.

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,840
Thank you.

11
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,600
Slow.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,480
Thanks, mate.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
Righto, come through.

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,520
Jesus, stop the car! Arggh!

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
Sir, are you alright? Are you hurt?!

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,160
Alright, I'm gonna try
and open the door, alright?

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
Oh, he smells like a brewery.

18
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,080
I was going to bring you that cuppa.
Looked like hard work out there.

19
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
It is.

20
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,040
Don't we have a vacuum cleaner for
that sort of thing?

21
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,520
It's not working.

22
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,160
Well, you know there's an appliance
fair at the co-op this week.

23
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
Oh! You'll enjoy that.

24
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,280
I'll get it.

25
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,000
Dr Blake's surgery.
One moment, please.

26
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,640
It's for you.

27
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,160
Oh, Danny. How's your morning?
Terrible!

28
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,840
Almost got killed. How about you?

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
Yes, me too. What's the story?

30
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,920
Straightforward drunk driver.
I'll just leave it to Gus.

31
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,280
Right, so, everyone's safe.
Who was it?

32
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,320
Travelling salesman. He died at the
scene on the Creswick Road.

33
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,720
And how do we know he's a salesman?

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
Oh, backseat of the car
was full of gear.

35
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
Head back to the crash site,
look through his car.

36
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,520
Make sure you get the man's
personals.

37
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,840
Can I take a car?
That bloke wrecked my pushie.

38
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Walk. Be good for you -
and you can go home.

39
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,600
There's nothing here for you.

40
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,840
Good. Right. Well, feel free to waste
my time whenever it suits.

41
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,160
Uh, Doc? Doc, Doc?
Yes?

42
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,320
What would make a bloke's face turn
blue?

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
Gus! I was curious too.
What do you make of the colour?

44
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,200
Professional curiosity,
or are you just here to annoy me?

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,200
As always, Gus, I'm here to help.

46
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,200
Hey!

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,160
You should have seen
your face.

48
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,760
Do you mind?!

49
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,760
You actually left the ground!

50
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,840
Yeah, very bloody funny, alright?!

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh, there's no need to be like that.

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,440
I was nearly killed earlier today,
so it's not a joke, alright?

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,560
Well, maybe you need to toughen up
a little bit there.

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,120
Don't suppose I could grab a lift.
Come on, it's halfway out of town!

55
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,720
Well, maybe that'll teach you not to
bite my head off next time.

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,440
The walk'll do you good,
get that blood pumping.

57
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,240
Ray Beck, travelling salesman.

58
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,440
Looks like a film star.

59
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,440
Women must've been all over him.

60
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,560
Do I detect a hint of envy there,
Gus? Done the bloods?

61
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,160
Not yet.
Obviously another drink driver.

62
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,240
Really?
You didn't smell his clothes?

63
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,920
No, but I smelled his mouth.
No trace.

64
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,160
You'd expect something there,
wouldn't you?

65
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,040
Colour suggests asphyxiation,
wouldn't you think?

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,360
Haemorrhagic stroke?

67
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,960
Hmm, might be right.

68
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,880
Cracked sternum. Minimal bruising.

69
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,320
I think he was dead
before he crashed the car.

70
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,760
Can I see his clothes?

71
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,040
Arggh!

72
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,200
Help yourself - his clothes.
They're too sharp for my taste.

73
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,200
Oh, I find that hard to believe, Gus.

74
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,320
Phew, I see what you mean
about the alcohol.

75
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,240
His trousers are covered in it.

76
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,960
Actually, only one leg.

77
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,120
Gus.

78
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,120
What do you make of these?

79
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,760
Acute infection
or some kind of poisoning.

80
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,960
Snake bite.

81
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
Arggh! Arggh!

82
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,480
Arggh!

83
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Lawson.
I told you to go home.

84
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,440
Is Danny still at the crash?
Yep.

85
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,640
You told him to search that car,
didn't you?
Yeah, why?

86
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,120
He might be in trouble.

87
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,280
Some help here! Mattie?
Get some help here!

88
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,080
Take his shoulders.

89
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,360
Right, oxygen, now!

90
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,800
I've got the treatment room
prepped! What kind of snake?

91
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,280
I don't know.

92
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,440
We can't give him anti-venom
if we don't know what kind of snake
it was.

93
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,040
I don't know!

94
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,480
Right, on my 'three'.
One, two, three.

95
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Pulse.
Onto it.

96
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
110.

97
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,200
Blake.

98
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,520
The men are looking for the snake.
They still haven't found it.

99
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,000
What do we do now?

100
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,440
Haemotoxic, cytoxic,
neurotoxic.

101
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,840
Haemotoxic, cytoxic...
Haemotoxic?

102
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
But from what you said, there was
obvious neural dysfunction.

103
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
What are you talking about?

104
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,640
We can't give him anti-venom
if we don't know what kind of snake
it was.

105
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,160
Can we give him something else?

106
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,480
We have three generalised vaccines.
Well, use one of those.

107
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,320
We don't know what the poison is...
Pulse again, please, please, please.

108
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
120.
He's in shock.

109
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,840
Danny!

110
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,720
Snake bite.

111
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,560
What kind of snake?
We don't know.

112
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, what are you gonna do?
Blake.

113
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,880
Lucien!

114
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
Blake?

115
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,680
What kind of snake?
I don't know.

116
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,160
Well, we can't give him anti-venom

117
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,160
if we don't know what kind of snake
it was.

118
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,640
Lucien?

119
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,040
Pit viper. Asian pit viper.
Asian?!

120
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,320
Native to Asia.
Not an Australian snake.

121
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,600
Two deep puncture marks from hollow
fangs. Very, very distinctive.

122
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,680
No Australian snake
has fangs quite like it.

123
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,200
You've treated a viper snake bite
before.

124
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
No, but I've read about it.
Are you sure about this?

125
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Not 100%, no.
But as sure as you possibly can be?

126
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,200
Please clear the room. Jean?

127
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,680
I'll wait in the corridor.

128
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,280
Alright, Mattie, haemotoxic.

129
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
Good.

130
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,320
120 over 80.

131
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,440
He's going to be alright.
Oh, thank God!

132
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,560
Perhaps he should stay with us until
he's feeling better.

133
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,040
Of course! Absolutely.

134
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,480
Well done.

135
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,360
An Asian pit viper.

136
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,800
Hmm. An educated guess.

137
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,000
How did a deadly foreign snake
get into that salesman's car?

138
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,400
Well, snakes crawl into cars
all the time.

139
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
Not Asian pit vipers, not here.

140
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,640
Well, some idiot bought it into the
country, let it escape.

141
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,080
Good job, Lucien.

142
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,280
Thank you, Matthew.

143
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,440
Right, see you again next week.

144
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,560
Claire Connolly!

145
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,120
How are you?

146
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,720
I can't find anything specifically
wrong with you, Mrs Connolly,

147
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,960
however, in general you are certainly
run-down.

148
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,600
Your heart rate is normal, your blood
pressure's a little high.

149
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,520
Have you been under
much stress lately?

150
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,000
My husband and I,
we run a boarding house.

151
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,440
There's been some drama lately.

152
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
One of the guests died in a car
crash.

153
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
Ray Beck.
You know him?

154
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Not really, no.
I gather he sold vacuum cleaners.

155
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,240
Apparently he was the best.

156
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,920
You know, my housekeeper is in need
of a new vacuum cleaner.

157
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,680
Oh. The house is full of salesmen.
You could name your price.

158
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,600
Latest model - the Constellation,
for your delight.

159
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,800
It is, as they say, pure heaven.

160
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,680
Heaven?
Mm-hm.

161
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,120
For the lady, therefore,
for the gentleman.

162
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,720
What about the Canterbury?
Hubby's on a budget, is he?

163
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,280
Erm, I'm just the housekeeper.
My apologies.

164
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,080
Like I said, free delivery, free
bags, one year's free servicing.

165
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,760
There's a sucker born every day.

166
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,160
This is my sale.
Jim Thurlston.

167
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,120
District's top salesman,
all domestic appliances.

168
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,640
Second top seller.
Haven't you noticed?

169
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,360
Ray's no longer with us.
Ray Beck, the chap who died?

170
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
That's right.

171
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,000
Bloke had the most amazing contacts,
especially in refrigeration.

172
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,480
Look, I just couldn't compete.

173
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,640
He's gone. I'm top dog now.

174
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,800
Gentlemen, surely a little healthy
competition isn't a bad thing.

175
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,080
Fine by me. That's because mulleton
here is never gonna match me.

176
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,360
Well, I'm off to find a cup of tea.
Hubby might leave you with it.

177
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,840
Hand on heart, all the ladies swear
by the Constellation.

178
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,240
You want a real deal?
Talk to the real salesman.

179
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,680
Mrs Connolly?

180
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,000
Mrs Connolly? Hello?

181
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,400
Don't you yell at me,
Frank Connolly!

182
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,120
Come here, woman!

183
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,680
I will bloody yell at you if I want
to. I have had it up to here...

184
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,960
You've had it?
Yes, I bloody have!

185
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,840
I hate you so much!

186
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,960
Don't you walk away from me!
Don't you give me orders.

187
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,440
Come here, woman!

188
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,280
See that?

189
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,600
Perfect suction every time.

190
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,840
Exactly the same model I was
offering.

191
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,160
But with free bags.
I said free bags.

192
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Year's warranty.
I can do that too.

193
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,800
Two sets of bags, year's warranty,
cost price.

194
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
How do I know it's the model
I really want?

195
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,080
You can borrow mine, try it out
and see if you like it.

196
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,680
Oh, thank you.

197
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
And if you like it,
do we have a deal?

198
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,600
There you are.

199
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,040
The A... the Asian pit viper hates
the cold, so that snake...

200
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
You know, the snake, there's no way
it would survive out here in the
bush.

201
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,400
What?!
The...

202
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,520
Never mind. How is it?

203
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,520
Well, it's fine, but it's not
picking up as well as it was before.

204
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,240
I think we need to empty the bag.

205
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,720
I'm sure that's probably relatively
easy to sort out.

206
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,400
Well, maybe you could do it for me.

207
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,560
Yes, of course.

208
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,840
I'm sure it's just a matter

209
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,000
of unfastening something on the side
or the back or...

210
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,640
There we are.

211
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,640
Oh, yeah!
'Relatively easy'?

212
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,920
Well, if it would just
do as it's told. Oh!

213
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,200
Don't worry, I'll fix all that up.

214
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,000
Hang on.

215
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,920
Constable, we'll need access
into here.

216
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Go and get the key
from Frank Connolly.

217
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,800
Sorry to disturb you
at a time like this.

218
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,320
Was the missus happy with the vacuum
she borrowed?

219
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah, the missus was ecstatic,
thank you.

220
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,320
Then I'll drop the machine
over tomorrow.

221
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,640
Tell me, was Mr Churchill
disappointed

222
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,920
he missed out on the sale?

223
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,200
It's dog eat dog in our line of
work, Doc.

224
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,160
Yeah.
What's with all the coppers?

225
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
Oh, I couldn't possibly comment,
Mr Thurlston. If you'll excuse me.

226
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,680
Is there a law against keeping a few
snakes or something?

227
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,440
Mmm, there is. You broke it.

228
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,040
I understand a Mr Raymond Beck
was staying here, Mr Connolly.

229
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Yeah, he was.

230
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,680
You know that he died?

231
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,120
Car crash, I heard. Hate to think
that booze was behind it.

232
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,040
He could always put it away.

233
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,920
Well, there's more than the car
crash.

234
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,520
He died from snake bite, and then
a young constable of mine got bitten

235
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,840
while he was searching his car
down near Kilburn.

236
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,960
The thing's still on the loose.

237
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,920
Now, you've got an empty cage
downstairs

238
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,320
that's supposed to have an Asian pit
viper inside.

239
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,760
Yeah, I didn't know it was missing
till that bloke broke in.

240
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,640
Where's the snake now?
No idea!

241
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,760
What do you mean,
you've got no idea?

242
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
It's supposed to be
in the bloody cage.

243
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,080
But I honestly don't know.

244
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,560
Look, I told you.

245
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,600
I always keep the key to the
basement on me.

246
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,440
I used to have a spare key, but...

247
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,160
Missing too, is it?

248
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,160
I've got a dead man who stayed here
and a young constable in hospital,

249
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,800
both bitten by a snake,
and you know nothing about it.

250
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,120
I need you to come down the station
and make a statement.

251
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,160
My men are going
to search Mr Beck's car,

252
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,560
and if they find a snake
and it's an Asian pit viper,

253
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,040
I'm charging you with murder.

254
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,440
This is where Ray Beck
was staying.

255
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,840
It's alright, Mrs Connolly.

256
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm sure this situation
isn't helping those issues

257
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,920
we discussed in my surgery.

258
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,920
If you feel the need to come back
and see me again, please do.

259
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,040
I do have to ask you a question,
I'm afraid.

260
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,320
Your husband mentioned the spare key
to the basement went missing.

261
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,520
Now, is this right?

262
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,840
Frank looked after the keys.

263
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,600
The basement wasn't
any of my business.

264
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,920
Of course.

265
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,760
Just one more thing, if I may.

266
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,280
Ray Beck was a very handsome man.

267
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,600
Did your husband have any reason,
any reason, to be jealous?

268
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
She was having an affair?
She's unhappy.

269
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,400
She has an affair with the handsome
salesman in the upstairs room,

270
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,840
then hubby finds out and sticks his
deadliest snake in her lover's car.

271
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,440
Well, how do you know she was
unhappy?

272
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,240
I heard them arguing. I was hiding in
their kitchen at the time.

273
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,800
You should've seen her expression
when you mentioned Ray Beck.

274
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,240
She was almost in tears!
The way she folded his clothes.

275
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,240
By the way,
did you find his sales notebook?

276
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,200
Apparently Ray was the region's top
seller,

277
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,160
but his notebook wasn't in his jacket
at the hospital.

278
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,760
Haven't found it. Why?

279
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,360
Their notebooks contain their
contacts,

280
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,440
and they treat these books like the
holy grail.

281
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,800
Word is that Ray's contacts were the
best.

282
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,360
No, haven't found it,
but there was something else.

283
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
The man liked to punt.

284
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,560
All these are marked 'unpaid'.

285
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,440
Goodness! £200, that's a lot to owe.

286
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,920
If it's the bookie I'm thinking of,

287
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,080
he wouldn't have been happy that
Beck couldn't pay.

288
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,280
Eddie Carlin, real lowlife.

289
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,680
Has a particular way
of writing his numbers.

290
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,560
Saw young Parks today.
Looks like he's on the mend.

291
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,200
Close thing, but yes.
Lawson.

292
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,800
Yep.

293
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,880
It's Hobart.
They've found the snake.

294
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,000
Well?

295
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,400
Yeah.

296
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
That's a pit viper.

297
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,200
Frank Connolly, I'm arresting you on
the charges of murder,

298
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,200
attempted murder, possession of
dangerous animals as defined in the
relevant Acts.

299
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,360
You don't have to say anything at
this time,

300
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,040
but anything you say or do may be
given in evidence.

301
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
Do you understand?

302
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
Take him down.

303
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,080
Mrs Connolly.

304
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,560
Are they charging Frank?

305
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,960
Yes, they are. Can you... can you
tell me what happened?

306
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,680
There's no way he would have
ever hurt Ray.

307
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,080
Well, that's not how it looks,
Mrs Connolly.

308
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,480
Now, I know you and your husband
weren't exactly happy.

309
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,240
But Frank wouldn't hurt anyone.

310
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,640
Wives often say that, Mrs Connolly.

311
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,200
But I know Frank!

312
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,320
Then please tell me
what happened with Ray.

313
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,120
Oh!
Mrs Connolly!

314
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,240
No admissions yet, but that'll come.

315
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,200
What about that bookie
you were talking about?

316
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,680
Carlin? Lowlife scum.

317
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,280
Have to get him on something else.

318
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,440
Mr Carlin will see you now.

319
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
Yep, righto, Harry.
Yep, right, OK, gotcha. See ya.

320
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,360
Ray Beck said you'd give good odds at
today's meet at Flemington.

321
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,440
Ray Beck ain't worth a toss.

322
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,360
Don't bring idiots like this in here
again.

323
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,000
Come on.
Wait!

324
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,600
Listen, I need to place a few bets,

325
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,440
and I'm guessing Ray owing you
money's left a bit of a hole.

326
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,120
What do you know about Beck?

327
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,760
That he died.

328
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,360
Real shame.

329
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,920
Must've been somewhat annoying,
Ray dying and owing you money.

330
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,720
You talk too much.

331
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,960
Hello? Ah, yeah. Spring flutter?
OK, mate. Yep, see ya.

332
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,840
Look, I'd like to take a piece of
that action, if I may.

333
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,320
Spring Flutter for a win in the
fourth.

334
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,840
20:1.

335
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,600
5, and Landed Gentry for a place in
the sixth, £5.

336
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,880
16:1.
Good.

337
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,520
I guess it's not really in your
interests to kill someone

338
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,080
if they owe you money.

339
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,680
Sterling Silver in the ninth.
Winner or place, £5.

340
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,840
You kill them, you don't get your
money back, do you?

341
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,640
Well, if depends.
I need to set an example.

342
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,480
And how would you do that, exactly?

343
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,320
Would you ever use a snake to make an
example of someone?

344
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,240
Who is this guy, boss?
I've no idea, Maurice.

345
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,880
But he's lucky, he's lucky you got
a sense of humour.

346
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,880
Yeah.

347
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,800
You've probably got less than five
seconds

348
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,720
to tell me exactly what you want.

349
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,120
Right, well, when you put it that
way, I... Please, just...

350
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,680
I just need to find out more about
Ray Beck.

351
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,680
Nothing about you.

352
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,200
Oh, why didn't you say so?
Rubbish punter!

353
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,200
He owed me 200 quid. He's lucky
I didn't get to him first.

354
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,480
Pretty boy.

355
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,840
Apparently the bloke couldn't keep
it in his pants.

356
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,600
It's almost
a dead heat

357
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,200
between Acapella
and Sterling Silver.

358
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,320
It'll be remembered for the fourth
that lasted longer than the race.

359
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,880
Mr Carlin said there wasn't much
return for you today.

360
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,520
Oh, I don't know.
I think I got what I needed.

361
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,480
Oh, and he said to say you're
welcome back at any time.

362
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,000
Well, thank you, Maurice.
You tell Mr Carlin I'm honoured.

363
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,960
Hi! How are you feeling?

364
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
Yeah, pretty weak still.

365
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,200
I'm not surprised.
I brought you something.

366
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,800
Thanks.
It was the least I can do.

367
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,360
You feel up for this?
Yeah.

368
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,560
What sort?
You choose.

369
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,280
Oh.

370
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,440
What?

371
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,160
I'm sorry.
What?

372
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,600
You should see your face.

373
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Oh, I can't believe you were gonna
feed that to me!

374
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,880
That's hilarious!

375
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,720
Ma... Mattie!

376
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,760
Oh!

377
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,120
Bloody...

378
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,960
Jean?

379
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,880
I see your new vacuum's arrived.

380
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,040
Oh, has it?
Yes.

381
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,400
I thought you might've unpacked it
by now.

382
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,960
Now, I've had other things to do.

383
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,600
Right. Here's hoping it makes
something of a difference, eh?

384
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,600
Tell me, what do you know about the
Connollys?

385
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,880
The Connollys - married young.

386
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,680
The house has been in the family
for years.

387
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,240
Frank and Claire have had to rent
rooms out.

388
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,080
Hard times?
Hard times. Pass the whetstone?

389
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,800
Yes.

390
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,240
Frank was a champion full forward
till he did his knee.

391
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,280
She's nice. Seems unhappy.

392
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,320
I wouldn't have thought he's the
kind of man who would kill anyone,
though.

393
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Well, did you think
he was the kind of man

394
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,160
who'd keep snakes in his basement?

395
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,200
Oh, I stand corrected!

396
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Any reason for the unhappiness?
Should there be?

397
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,200
Well, yes, I'd have thought so.

398
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,200
Oh, why don't you ask her yourself?

399
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,280
Huh. I have absolutely no idea.
Really? No idea at all?

400
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,520
No. I missed something?

401
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,520
No, I'm sure you're right.

402
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,760
It's probably just that time of the
month or the stars have aligned...

403
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,240
Mattie.

404
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,480
I'm sure Jean loves
being taken for granted
just as much as the rest of us,

405
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,040
and God help us all if any of us
started complaining.

406
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,840
The whole bloody world would end.

407
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,800
Yes?! Dr Lucien Blake.

408
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,960
I wouldn't have called you.

409
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,680
The bloke doesn't seem to be in
any danger. It's just... strange.

410
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,080
Has he been this way the whole time?

411
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,400
Usually used to the blokes who want
to take me on.

412
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,640
Mr Connolly!

413
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,760
You need me to stay?
No, I'll be fine.

414
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,040
Mr Connolly, it's Dr Blake.

415
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,520
Is there anything I can do for you?

416
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,280
I want to die.

417
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,120
Mr Connolly, whatever you say to me

418
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,920
I will hold in the strictest
confidence.

419
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,560
Claire never deserved this.

420
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,640
Deserved what?

421
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,000
Mr Connolly, please.

422
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,840
Leave me alone.

423
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,760
Morning. Are you alright to walk?

424
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,760
Jean...
How are you?

425
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,320
Fine.

426
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,120
You're gonna be a bit slow
for a while.
I'm fine!

427
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,560
You're coming to stay with us for a
few days. I'll set up the spare
room.

428
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,200
Is Mattie gonna be there?
Yeah.

429
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,080
Right.

430
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,080
Well, come on through. We'll get you
settled and I'll pop the kettle on.

431
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,840
Hey.

432
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,640
Oh, I was rather enjoying that.
G'day.

433
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,320
I'll put you here, Danny,
till I've set up the spare room.

434
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,800
Yes.

435
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,120
I'll leave you to it.
You're not staying for lunch,
Mattie?

436
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,520
Uh, no, I'm going out.

437
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,640
I might get you to drop me at work,
if that's alright.

438
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,200
Boss doesn't like being a man down,

439
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,880
and the boys have been covering for
me...

440
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,000
No, no, no, no, Danny.
You're just out of hospital.

441
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,240
Doc, I'm good, and I don't wanna be
hanging around, you know?

442
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,840
Danny, I really would...
I'm fine, really!

443
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,640
I'll be on my way.

444
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,920
Thank you, Mrs Thompson.
You take care now.

445
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,320
New hobby.

446
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,560
Hmm.

447
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,560
What do you think of him?

448
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,600
Too smooth for my taste.

449
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,720
What about him?

450
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,400
Well, he's fine if you're
a 16-year-old girl,

451
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,920
but the rest of us have more
important things to worry about.

452
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,520
What would you think

453
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,320
if I started cutting these chaps out
of our magazines?

454
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,240
Yes.

455
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,720
Just returning your vacuum cleaner.

456
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,280
Oh! Mrs Beazley says thank you.

457
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm afraid we had a blockage.

458
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,360
Your husband...
He's innocent!

459
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,840
They should let him go.

460
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,560
Claire, how long have you known?

461
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,520
When did you first realise Frank was
homosexual?

462
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,040
He'd beat you to a pulp if you'd
said that to his face!

463
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,760
Yes, he probably would,
but I think it's also the reason

464
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,280
he's currently catatonic on the floor
of a cell back at the police station.

465
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,160
Is he alright?

466
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,240
He's not doing well.
He's in deep trauma.

467
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,400
Can I see him?
Not till he goes to remand.

468
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,800
Now, your husband and Ray were
lovers, weren't they?

469
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Claire, it's not your fault.
It's not his fault.

470
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,760
In fact, it's not even a question of
fault.

471
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,760
Modern research...

472
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,240
What does modern research
know about my marriage?!

473
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,240
Probably not much, but it suggests,
it suggests,

474
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,920
that this has been a part of Frank
right from the very beginning,

475
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,880
right from the start, just like hair
colour or eye colour.

476
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,200
This has nothing to do with you.

477
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,480
I didn't understand at first.

478
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,800
I just thought it was me.

479
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,240
I started to wonder.

480
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,920
Then I found him with someone.

481
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,560
He said he'd change,
but he couldn't.

482
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,080
So, Ray wasn't your husband's
first lover?

483
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,720
No, there were others.

484
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,200
Sometimes the men
who passed through here.

485
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,240
He only met Ray a few months ago.

486
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,200
I had never seen him
like this before.

487
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,040
He was...
Happy.

488
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,960
Claire, do you think your husband
could have killed Ray?

489
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,840
He couldn't have.

490
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,200
He loved him.

491
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,400
So, what's this about?

492
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,120
Connolly and Beck were lovers.

493
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,440
Trying to eat my lunch!

494
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,080
I'm sorry to offend
your sensibilities.

495
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,360
You realise that if this is true,
I'll have to charge Connolly

496
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
with unnatural acts on top of
everything else.

497
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,480
Well, you could,
but I hope you don't.

498
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,920
Where did this piece of information
come from?

499
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,000
Well, I completely missed it,

500
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
but Ray had the only single room in
the place -

501
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,000
a place where everyone else has to
share.

502
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,480
Doesn't mean he's a...

503
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,600
No, no, no, but Frank Connolly was
the one who assigned the rooms.

504
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,480
His wife confirmed it.

505
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,720
Always thought she was
a reasonable-looking woman, myself.

506
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,440
Yes, and Eddie Carlin told me Ray
couldn't keep it in his trousers.

507
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,920
Eddie Carlin?
Mmm.

508
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,080
Of course, we all assumed he was
talking about the ladies,

509
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,760
and I thought Claire and Connolly
were fighting over Ray,

510
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,200
and of course, they were,
only not quite as I imagined.

511
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,840
Maybe they were just a couple of
blokes having a little tiff.

512
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,720
Well, Claire doesn't think so.
It sounded like they were soul mates.

513
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,280
Oh!

514
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,440
So, I may have encouraged you to
arrest the wrong man.

515
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,760
Still, means we can rule out
Eddie Carlin.

516
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,680
Jesus, Blake.

517
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,160
You don't think Mrs Connolly...

518
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,960
Took revenge on her husband's lover?
Possibly, but I doubt it.

519
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,880
Parks, get me the Connolly file.

520
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,240
I really don't think it was her,

521
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,400
and I'm not convinced Danny should be
back at work.

522
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,440
Well, it was only a little snake.

523
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,920
Jean?

524
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,040
I'm a little bit stuck. I'd love
a chat, but if you're busy...

525
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,360
Oh, I think I can manage.
Is this about the Connollys?

526
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,920
Yes.

527
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,160
Turns out she's not having an affair.
He was, with one of his boarders.

528
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,400
The chap who died.
Oh!

529
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,080
Would you have guessed?
No! He was always attentive.

530
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,160
Just like any married couple, eh?

531
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,000
Well, there's more
than one kind of marriage.

532
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,120
I was only married a very short time,
so I'm afraid I'm no expert.

533
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,000
Thing is, the basement was locked,
there was only one key.

534
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,760
Are you sure about that?

535
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,000
Well, there was another key,
but it was missing?

536
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,400
So, who else could get into that
basement?

537
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,800
Did Frank any other lovers?

538
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,280
Claire said quite a few,

539
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
but once Ray showed up on the scene,
that was that.

540
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,280
So, why else would you want
to put a snake in his car?

541
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,640
You know, they're a competitive
bunch, theses salesmen,

542
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,960
and apparently Ray was the best,

543
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,440
and it would appear someone
has stolen his book of contacts.

544
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,400
So, how would you like to go about
this, Dr Blake?

545
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,520
Danny? Yes.

546
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,160
Listen, I might need your help
with something.

547
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,320
Ah, Jean, allow me.

548
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,720
Now, are you ready?
I think so.

549
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,120
Danny, give us five minutes and then
come up, yes?

550
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,120
OK.

551
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,800
I sold you that machine.
We had a deal.

552
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,280
Well, I think we can do better.
You can't do better.

553
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,080
I'm the region's top seller.

554
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,880
Since Ray died. Care to give it a go,
Mr Churchill?

555
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,120
He already tried
and he couldn't do it.

556
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,120
Keen to have another go, Doctor.

557
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,120
And just to add a little bit of
a sweetener,

558
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,840
Mattie here could use a small
refrigerator.

559
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,320
This is my sale.

560
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,240
I'm sick to death of you scrimping
on spending

561
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,960
and then splashing out on whatever
SHE wants!

562
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,880
Oh, yes, that's right -
pretend to be innocent.

563
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,880
Ladies, ladies, I think we can find
something that keeps you both happy.

564
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,680
Same great machine, same price,
two free bags and a year's warranty.

565
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,760
I'll match it.
And you've already got the machine.

566
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,080
I've got one in my car.
How do you like ice-cold juice,
sweetheart?

567
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,040
I've got all the latest fridges
for you, cost price.

568
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,600
And that's better than you'll ever
be able to do.

569
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,320
It's killing me, but for someone as
pretty as yourself,

570
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,160
20% off cost, free delivery,
and the Constellation as we agreed,

571
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,360
and I've got the Constellation
in my car, if we're done.

572
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,800
I'll get my contact book.
But that's... wrong.

573
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,840
How can you get 20% off cost?
Only Ray could go that low.

574
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,240
Yes, that's interesting,
Mr Churchill.

575
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,840
The other day you couldn't beat Jim
here on the price of a vacuum.

576
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,720
Today you can,

577
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,440
and also today you can offer
tremendous discounts on fridges.

578
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,840
I thought that was solely Ray's
territory,

579
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,000
and I'm guessing that's probably
Ray's contact book,

580
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,160
the one you stole
after you murdered him.

581
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,640
This is my contact...

582
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,640
Mrs Connolly, do you have the key the
young constable returned to you?

583
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,960
Yes.
Thank you.

584
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,880
Identical.

585
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,960
The missing spare key to the basement
on your key ring, Mr Churchill.

586
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,680
This is my con...

587
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,040
Hey, stop! Stop there!

588
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,240
Stop!

589
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,920
Jean, see to Danny, please!
I'm fine!

590
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,760
Danny, are you alright?

591
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,920
We need to get you back to the
hospital.

592
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,600
Anything for a sale, Mr Churchill.

593
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,400
Told you not to go back to work.

594
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,560
I was feeling better.

595
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,760
You weren't ready.
Two days bed rest, minimum.

596
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,800
You're coming home with us
and taking it easy.

597
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,520
Oh, no, I might... go home.

598
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,320
Danny!
No, it'll be fine.

599
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,920
Afternoon.
Excuse me.

600
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,040
All good, just not quite ready to
exert himself.

601
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,360
Would you be interested in sitting
in on the interview?

602
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,040
Churchill?
Of course.

603
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,000
Listen, you say g'day.
I'll just be a moment.

604
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,520
Mattie.

605
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,680
You should go in and see him.

606
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,680
I'm sure he's just fine without me.

607
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:03,120
So, you and Frank Connolly
were lovers,

608
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,240
then Ray came on the scene.

609
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,480
Frank didn't want to know me
after that.

610
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,040
What about the snakes?

611
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,880
I knew where Frank
kept the spare key.

612
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,720
So you took it
and then you stole the snake.

613
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,960
Mmm.

614
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,280
Do you think
it's easy being like this?

615
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,400
Do you think I want to?
Mr Churchill...

616
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,400
I never asked for this.

617
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,320
You despise me, don't you?

618
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,720
I... I disgust you, don't I?

619
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:48,360
Mr Churchill, I spent some time
in a prisoner of war camp,

620
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,360
and there was a young man there,

621
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,560
he was executed just before we were
liberated.

622
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,480
He tried to steal medical supplies
to save his mates.

623
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,720
I had to read some of his letters to
get word back home,

624
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,160
and it was only then that I realised
the girlfriend he spoke of...

625
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,560
..wasn't a girl at all.

626
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,080
And he was the bravest man
I ever met.

627
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,840
I loved Frank.

628
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,680
But he loved someone else.

629
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,000
Yes?

630
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,440
Is it safe to come in?
Perhaps.

631
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,440
I just wanted to say thank you.

632
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,400
I still don't know
how you could afford

633
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,880
to buy us a brand-new vacuum cleaner
and a refrigerator.

634
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,600
Well, believe it or not,
I had a little win on the horses.

635
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,080
Oh!

636
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,400
Erm, happy birthday for tomorrow.
I hadn't forgotten.

637
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,120
Lucien!

638
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,480
Well, go on, open it.

639
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,680
Oh, thank you!

640
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,640
It's beautiful.

641
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,240
Was it hers?

642
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,760
No.

643
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,240
No, I, um... I bought it
before the Japanese invaded,

644
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,320
and I thought it might make a good
present one day,

645
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,360
and indeed it has.

646
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,360
Happy birthday, Jean.

647
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,920
Drop the gun!

648
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,960
This is about
Sean McBride,

649
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,640
who murdered
a policeman.

650
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,280
Apparently.

651
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,800
The bloke wanted
to die.

652
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,800
And you saw McBride kill that man?
I was there.

653
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,280
McBride confessed.

654
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,760
He killed Cooper

655
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,400
and took a shot
at Parks and Hobart.

656
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,240
There was a second wound

657
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,240
caused by a blow
to the back of the head

658
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,720
inflicted before
he was shot.

659
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,320
What would you say if I told you

660
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,800
I'd discovered certain links

661
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,560
between Sean McBride
and the police.

662
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Do you know who
he passed
information on to?

663
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,760
The entire case
against Sean McBride

664
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,240
was circum-bloody-stantial!

665
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,880
He confessed!
It was a lie!

666
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,400
Admissions?
No!

667
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,040
Did McBride recant?
No

668
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,520
Then you've got nothing!

669
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,160
They want someone to hang!
